  <h1>Pupusas</h1>
  <img src="https://www.allrecipes.com/thmb/EdN7jVEOaul1ZSeOq2OVL3tR7Ns=/750x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/5061638-93061a303c0047b68e1d2ef3ed113952.jpg" alt="Pupusas Dish" >
  <p>This is a fairly authentic version of the popular <strong>Salvadorean dish </strong>. It does take some time, however it is well worth the
  effort! You can purchase pre-made chicharron at specialty markets, however this recipe tastes just like it. I also make
  the salsa roja and curtido ahead of time (the salsa freezes very well, and the curtido can stay in the fridge at least a
  week).</p>

  <h1>Directions</h1>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>Combine tomato sauce, water, cilantro, green bell pepper, onion, crushed garlic, bouillon cube, and salt in a saucepan
      over medium-low heat. Cook and stir until vegetables are soft, about 20 minutes. Let salsa roja cool for 10 minutes.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Fill a blender halfway with the salsa roja. Cover and hold lid down with a potholder; pulse a few times before leaving
      on to blend. Pour into a bowl. Repeat with remaining salsa roja. Return to saucepan and simmer for 10 minutes more
      stirring occasionally. Allow to cool completely, about 1 hour, and refrigerate.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Place cabbage and carrots in a large bowl. Add 4 cups boiling water and let stand for 5 minutes. Drain well. Mix in
      vinegar, scallions, oregano, and red pepper flakes. Chill curtido until serving.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until almost fully cooked and not
      yet crispy, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer bacon and grease (if desired) to a food processor. Add tomatoes, quartered green
      bell pepper, Monterey Jack cheese, and minced garlic. Puree and season the chicharron with salt.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Mix masa harina and 1/2 cup water together in a bowl by hand. Add the remaining water slowly, about 2 tablespoons at a
      time, mixing well after each addition, until dough is moist but still firm. Cover with a wet towel.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Heat 1/2 cup oil a large skillet over medium-high heat.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Take a golf ball-sized piece of dough and roll into a ball in your hands. Make a hole in the dough ball with your thumb;
      put a small amount of chicharron inside the hole, close it up, and flatten the ball with your hands into a thick
      tortilla shape. Place pupusa in the skillet and fry until golden brown, about 2 minutes per side. Repeat with the
      remaining dough and chicharron.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Serve each pupusa topped with 2 tablespoons of curtido and 1 tablespoon of salsa roja.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
