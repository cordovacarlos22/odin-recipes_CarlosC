  <img src="https://www.shutterstock.com/shutterstock/photos/2040336509/display_1500/stock-photo-tamale-typical-colombian-food-wrapped-in-banana-leaves-2040336509.jpg" alt="Honduran Tamales Dish" width="400" height="300">
  <p>This dish is made of masa, which is steamed or boiled in a leaf wrapper, which is discarded before eating. Tamales can
  be filled with meats, cheeses, fruits, vegetables, chilies or any preparation according to taste, and both the filling
  and the cooking liquid may be seasoned.</p>
  <h1>Ingredients</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>1 (4 pound) package masa harina (such as Maseca®), divided</li>
    <li>1 large tomato, chopped</li>
    <li>1 large green bell pepper, chopped</li>
    <li>1 large onion, chopped</li>
    <li>1 cup chopped fresh cilantro</li>
    <li>¼ cup ground cumin</li>
    <li>2 cubes chicken bouillon</li>
    <li>salt to taste</li>
    <li>1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste</li>
    <li>3 cups vegetable oil, or to taste</li>
    <li>30 banana leaves</li>
    <li>3 ½ pounds cubed cooked pork</li>
    <li>3 large potatoes, peeled and cubed</li>
    <li>2 cups cooked white rice</li>
    <li>1 (15 ounce) can peas, drained</li>
    <li>kitchen twine</li>
  </ul>
  <h1>Directions</h1>
  <ol>
    <li>Pour about 3/4 of the masa harina into a large pot. Add water in batches, mixing until a moderately thin batter forms.</li>
    <li>Combine tomato, bell pepper, onion, cilantro, cumin, and bouillon in a blender. Blend until smooth. Pour into the pot
    with the batter and season with salt. Pour about 5 cups of this combined mixture into a smaller pot; add tomato paste
    and stir until it is an even red color.</li>
    <li>Pour 2 cups oil into the large pot of batter; pour remaining 1 cup oil into the smaller pot of red batter. Bring both
    pots to a boil, stirring continuously to prevent burning. Cook until flavors set, 3 to 5 minutes more. Remove from heat.</li>
    <li>Cut banana leaves into 12x15-inch rectangles. Spoon 1 cup regular batter and 1/4 cup red batter into the center of each
    leaf. Add small amounts of pork, potatoes, rice, and peas. Fold leaf over the filling several times; fold sides in. Wrap
    twine around tamale to hold in place.</li>
    <li>Place tamales in a large pot; cover halfway with water. Cover and cook over medium heat until filling has thickened,
    about 1 hour.</li>
  </ol>

  <h1>Tips</h1>
  <p>After 1 hour of cooking, remove a tamale, let cool for 5 minutes, and unroll onto a plate to see if it has thickened. If
  the tamale is still a little runny, return it to the pot and continue cooking the batch for 20 to 30 minutes longer.
